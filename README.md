# .dotfiles

Some parts of the dotfiles I use on my personal machine

## Current endeavours

- I am following Josean-dev's Tmux video
- I want to understand what ThePrimeagen's tmux script is doing

## Past endeavours

- I used an prebuilt neovim config called AstroNvim pretty much without any customization
- I followed ThePrimeagen's Vimrc video and have the config setup on my Linux machine
- I followed Josean Martinez's video and have the config setup on my Mac
