# .dotfiles

Various configuration dotfiles I have on my personal machine

## Endeavours

- When I first got into Neovim, I used a prebuilt config called NvChad without any customization and then AstroNvim with minimal customization
- I followed ThePrimeagen's Vimrc video and have his config setup on my Linux machine
- I followed Josean Martinez's video and have his config setup on my Mac
- I naively adapted ThePrimeagen's tmux-sessionizer script for my Mac
  - I set it up so that it can be run with a keyboard shortcut from both the terminal and inside Neovim.
