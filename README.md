# .dotfiles

Various configuration dotfiles I have on my personal machine

## Current endeavours

- I am following Josean-dev's Tmux video
- I want to set up tmux-sessionizer specific shortcuts (Prime video)

## Past endeavours

- I used an prebuilt neovim config called AstroNvim pretty much without any customization
- I followed ThePrimeagen's Vimrc video and have the config setup on my Linux machine
- I followed Josean Martinez's video and have the config setup on my Mac
- I stole ThePrimeagen's tmux-sessionizer script
